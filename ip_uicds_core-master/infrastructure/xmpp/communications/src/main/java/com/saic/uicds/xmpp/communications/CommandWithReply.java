/**
 * Class to encapsulate the sending of an XMPP stanza (mainly IQs) and wait (given a timeout) for a
 * response based on matching ids. The timeout value is configured by setting the timeout value on
 * the connection that was used to factory this CommandWithReply.
 * 
 * The construction of an instance of this class sends the actual XMPP stanza. Well-formed checks
 * and validation on the stanza should be performed before creating an instance of this class. The
 * response can be obtained using getResult after waitForSuccessOrFailure returns true. If a false
 * result is returned then there was an error returned information about which can be obtained
 * through several accessors.
